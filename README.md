# Classic Arcade Game Clone (Frogger)

Frogger is a 1981 arcade game. The objective of the game is to guide the player (a frog in the classic game) to one of the water-blocks at the top of the screen. The player starts at the bottom of the screen (grass-blocks) and must pass through the stone-blocks, where there are  bugs speeding along horizontally, without colliding with them.

## About
This is the fourth project of the Google Front-End Nanodegree Program. 
The student must take the starting code (which includes some HTML, some CSS and some JS) and transform it to an interactive game by adding JavaScript code.


## Getting Started

Just open the HTML file in your browser and start playing.


## Prerequisites

    Browser
    Internet connection


## Instructions

- First of all you should clone/download the repository and then open index.html file in your browser.

- After opening the html file, you will see on the screen 6 rows of blocks, some bugs crossing the stone-blocks and a player (this is you). 

- The first two rows, where the player is safe from enemies, are grass-blocks and the next 3 ones are the stone-rocks where all the bugs circulate. The player's objective is to reach the last row of blocks (water-blocks) without colliding with the enemies. 

- The player can move up (up arrow), down (down arrow), right (right arrow) or left (left arrow).

- At the beginning of the game the player has 5 lives.

- Every time the player reaches the water, the score increases by 1.

- Every time the player collides with an enemy, the lives decrease by 1.

- When the lives finish, the score becomes 0 again, the lives 5 and the game starts from the beginning.
